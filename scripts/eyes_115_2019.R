###here you could just eyeball the row that is the first visit for each tag, extrat that data and save it. 
#the next code in theory should extract just the first visit for each tag and you could save that df without having to filter by row. 

#extract the latency of the first visit from the reference tag for each tag from the t2 dataframe. please double check the final df matches the one above for latency PER TAG. cross reference output here with the above df output. latencies should be the same
