###FOR EMMA TO ADD THE CODE TO ADD THE NESTBOX AND YEAR TO data frame t2

#create a column 'latency' where the date of each row is subtrated from the first row #this data isn't used but it shows you all latecies relative to the reference tag for every visit . its a good sanity check to make sure dataframe is right

###here you could just eyeball the row that is the first visit for each tag, extrat that data and save it. 
#the next code in theory should extract just the first visit for each tag and you could save that df without having to filter by row. 

#extract the latency of the first visit from the reference tag for each tag from the t2 dataframe. please double check the final df matches the one above for latency PER TAG. cross reference output here with the above df output. latencies should be the same
